  ## Description
  Project #2 from JavaScript30. Clock using JavaScript and CSS. 
  <br>

  This application uses the following technologies: JavaScript and CSS.
  <br><br>
  I changed a few things for my version. In order to address the jump by the second hand when it reaches the 12 position, I put in an if statement that removes the transition and re-assigns it in the next second.

  I also updated the CSS. I made my own cubic-bezier pattern that was more pleasing to my eyes. I slightly shortened the hour hand. Once I lowered the width, I needed to add in a left margin of equal percentage so it would remain in the correct place. Additionally, I made each hand a slightly different thickness. Then I added a new background image (from a movie I love) and changed the colors of the hands and clock border using colors in the image. Last, I added an ocarina to the center to cover the base of the hands and as a nod to the film plot.
